### Type

7种基本类型
- string
- number
- boolean
- **null**
- **undefined**
- object
- **symbol** --- ES6

在js中, 还定义了一些object类型的**子类型**:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Object
- Function
- Array
- Date
- RegExp
- Error
- **等其他** --- ES6


> In both cases, we call a property or method on a string primitive, and the engine **automatically coerces** it to a String object, so that the property/method access works.

> The same sort of coercion happens between the number literal primitive 42 and the new Number(42) object wrapper, when using methods like 42.359.toFixed(2). Likewise for Boolean objects from "boolean" primitives.

> **null and undefined** have no object wrapper form, only their primitive values. By contrast, Date values can only be created with their constructed object form, as they have no literal form counter-part.

> **Objects, Arrays, Functions, and RegExps** (regular expressions) are all objects regardless of whether the literal or constructed form is used. The constructed form does offer, in some cases, more options in creation than the literal form counterpart. Since objects are created either way, the simpler literal form is almost universally preferred. Only use the constructed form if you need the extra options.

> **Error** objects are rarely created explicitly in code, but usually created automatically when exceptions are thrown. They can be created with the constructed form new Error(..), but it's often unnecessary.
