### Javascript中某些术语
【常量】
 A constant is: a variable that **cannot be reassigned**.  -- 常量: 变量不能被赋值.(换句话, 变量可以修改)

【同构】
What would isomorphic JS be if there were such a thing? Well, it could be that you have one set of JS code that is converted to another set of JS code, and that (importantly) you could convert from the latter back to the former if you wanted.
-- 同构JS的含义: A代码 和 B代码可以相互转换, 但是A和B并不相同

【闭包】
.Conceptually, the structure of a closure is not mutable.
-- 从概念上讲, 一旦形成闭包, 那么结构是不可变的

【Closure Vs Object】
In places where I want to allow reassignment but restrict its surface area, closures are a more convenient and flexible formore than objects. In places where I want no reassignment, a frozen object is a lot more convenient than repeating const declarations all over my function.
-- 闭包和Frozen Object在某些地方都很方便

【函子】
A functor is a value that has a utility for using an operator function on that value.
--函子的定义： 能利用自身的特征来操作自身的值

【谓语函数】
A function that returns true / false for this kind of decision making goes by the special name: predicate function.
-- 某个函数返回true 或 false， 那么该函数称为谓语函数

【IIFE】
Immediately Invoked Function Expression -- 自执行函数表达式
