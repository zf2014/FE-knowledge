##  constructor vs ngOnInit

#### constructor的作用

> Bearing this in mind, there is a suitable scenario for using the constructor. This is when we want to utilise dependency injection - essentially for “wiring up” dependencies into the component.

可以通过构造器来加载改组件需要的依赖


--------------------
#### ngOnInit

> ngOnInit is purely there to give us a signal that Angular has finished initialising the component.

> This phase includes the **first pass at Change Detection** against the properties that we may bind to the component itself - such as using an @Input() decorator.

> Due to this, the @Input() properties are available inside ngOnInit, however are undefined inside the constructor, by design.

该函数是angular生命周期onInit对应的钩子. 当组件完成初始化会调用该钩子.@Input属性可以在钩子内使用, 而在构造器中, 该属性是undefined.
