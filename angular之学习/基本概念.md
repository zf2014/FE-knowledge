##  知识点

#### constructor的作用

> Bearing this in mind, there is a suitable scenario for using the constructor. This is when we want to utilise dependency injection - essentially for “wiring up” dependencies into the component.

可以通过构造器来加载改组件需要的依赖


--------------------
#### ngOnInit

> ngOnInit is purely there to give us a signal that Angular has finished initialising the component.

> This phase includes the **first pass at Change Detection** against the properties that we may bind to the component itself - such as using an @Input() decorator.

> Due to this, the @Input() properties are available inside ngOnInit, however are undefined inside the constructor, by design.

该函数是angular生命周期onInit对应的钩子. 当组件完成初始化会调用该钩子.@Input属性可以在钩子内使用, 而在构造器中, 该属性是undefined.


--------------------
#### View
> This type of abstraction represents an angular View. In angular world a View is a fundamental building block of the application UI. It is the **smallest** grouping of elements which are created and destroyed together. Angular philosophy encourages developers to see UI as a composition of Views, not as a tree of standalone html tags.

两种View形式：
> **Embedded Views** which are linked to a Template
> **Host Views** which are linked to a Component

--------------------
#### entry component

> An entry component is any component that Angular loads imperatively by type.
> A component loaded declaratively via its selector is not an entry component.
> The compiler can't discover these entry components by looking for them in other component templates. You must tell it about them by adding them to the **entryComponents** list.


如果某个组件的加载是通过指定类型完成的，那么该组件称为 entry component。
而通过selector加载的组件，则不是。大多数情况下，组件都是非entry component，但是也有个别组件：
1. AppComponent
2. route 指定的组件
3. 自定义动态加载组件

注: 如果使用entry component，那么必须明确通过添加模块的entryComponents列表中。
