#### Imperative 和 Declarative的含义

> Another way of describing this goal is with imperative vs declarative programming style. Imperative code is primarily concerned with explicitly stating how to accomplish a task. Declarative code states what the outcome should be, and leaves the implementation to some other responsibility.

Imperative关注的是how, 功能怎么实现
Declarative关注的是what, 功能是什么

**总结**: 对于读者来说Declarative形式的代码更加容易理解


```javascript
function getData() {
	return [1,2,3,4,5];
}

// imperative
var tmp = getData();
var a = tmp[0];
var b = tmp[3];

// declarative
var [ a ,,, b ] = getData();​
```
